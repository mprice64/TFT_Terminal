This is a very simple read-only serial terminal that reads Serial1 and prints the output to the Seedstudio TFT Touch Shield V1.0 mounted on an Arduino MEGA ADK.

I wrote it to be connected to the Mighty Ohm Geiger Counter v1.0

It includes the libraries that worked with Arduino 1.0.5-r2

The terminal is currently a hack job that neither constrains the length of serial input safely or the output to the display correctly.
