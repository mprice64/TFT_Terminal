This is a very simple read-only serial terminal that reads Serial1 and prints the output to the Seedstudio TFT Touch Shield V1.0 mounted on an Arduino MEGA ADK.

It includes the libraries that worked with Arduino 1.0.5-r2

The terminal is currently a hack job that neither constrains the length of serial input safely or the output to the display correctly.
